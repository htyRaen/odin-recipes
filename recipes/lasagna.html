        <h1>Homemade Lasagna</h1>
            <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
        <h2>Homemade Lasagna Ingredients</h2>
            <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade lasagna recipe:</p>  
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meat</strong>: This lasagna reciple starts with a pound of ground meat (1/2 pound ground pork, 1/2 pound lean ground beef).</li>
                <li><strong>Onion</strong>: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
                <li><strong>Canned tomatoes</strong>: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
                <li><strong>Fresh herbs</strong>: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
                <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
                <li><strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
                <li><strong>Noodles</strong>: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
                <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
                <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together)</li>
            </ul>
